## Front Invaders

A vertical shooter game made using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)

Survive waves of asteroids and enemy ships while destroying as many as possible to get the best score.

This is my first html5 game built using phaser. 

The code should be refactored and cleaned for usage with build tool or bundler such as webpack.

The assets should be packed into an atlas for less http requests while loading the assets.

The game require [Particle Storm](http://phaser.io/shop/plugins/particlestorm) plugin.
